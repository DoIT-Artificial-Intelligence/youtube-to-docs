## YouTube Automatic Captions

This tool relies on YouTube's captioning system. Please note that:
- **Availability:** Automatic captions are generated using speech recognition technology and may not be immediately available after upload.
- **Accuracy:** While improving, captions may misrepresent spoken content due to accents, dialects, or background noise.
- **Languages:** Support varies across numerous languages.
- **Troubleshooting:** Captions may not generate for long videos, poor audio quality, or multiple overlapping speakers.

For more details, see the official [YouTube Help: Use automatic captioning](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en).
